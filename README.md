  - Sad (Unhappiness or sorrow)
  - Angry (Displeasure)
  - Surprised (Astonishment)
  - Fearful (Anxiety or worry)
  - Disgusted (Aversion)
  - Neutral (No strong emotion)
- Confidence scores for each emotion
- Detailed emotion descriptions
- Multi-face emotion tracking

### 3. Background Segmentation
- Automatic background removal
- Clean foreground extraction
- Transparent background output
- High-quality edge detection

### 4. Scene Classification
- Environment type detection
- Detailed scene categorization:
  - Indoor/Outdoor classification
  - Natural/Urban environment detection
  - Specific location type identification
- Confidence scores for scene predictions

### 5. Analysis Reporting
- Comprehensive JSON reports
- Detailed image information
- Face detection statistics
- Emotion analysis summaries
- Scene classification results
